# BudgetApp
A GUI desktop application for tracking a budget. Shows an overview of income, spending, and overall balance.

This is an application developed using scala for money management. I built this using my understanding of Object Oriented principles in scala programming. 
The program requires an sbt (scala build tool) to run which can be installed as an extention in Visual Studio Code.
